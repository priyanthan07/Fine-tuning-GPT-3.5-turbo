# GPT-3.5 Turbo Fine-Tuning for Banking Sector Customer Complaints

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the fine-tuning of the GPT-3.5 Turbo model to improve its capability in handling customer complaints within the banking sector. The dataset used for fine-tuning is sourced from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) and comprises user complaints and responses. The primary goal is to create a more effective model for addressing customer grievances in the banking industry.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co). It consists of a collection of user complaints and corresponding responses within the banking sector. The dataset is essential for training and fine-tuning the model to ensure it understands and responds effectively to customer grievances.

## Workflow

The project workflow can be summarized into the following key steps:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Download the dataset from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) and upload it to the OpenAI platform for further processing.

5. **Inference**: Once the model is fine-tuned, it can be used for inference to generate responses to user complaints in real-time or in batch mode. This step ensures that the model provides helpful and relevant responses to customer grievances.

6. **Graphical Interface**: Develop a user-friendly graphical interface that allows easy interaction with the fine-tuned model. This interface will enable users to input customer complaints and receive responses from the model, facilitating efficient customer support in the banking sector.
